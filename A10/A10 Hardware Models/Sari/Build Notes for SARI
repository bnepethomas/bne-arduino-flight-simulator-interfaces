Build Notes for SARI

Roll Servo - https://core-electronics.com.au/9g-270-metal-servo-with-analog-feedback-1-5kg.html
AU$12

Th Roll Servo has a single horn connected to it.  
A bolt is needed to carry the extra length. It is 6mm long
If the horn is pressed down it will lock the servo in place
Use test code to position the servo at its mid-point (90 degrees).  The horn arm can be shortned a little. Attach the horn
so that points to the inside mounting bolt of the servo. This means at 90 degrees the ball presents a centre 
line.


The brown position lead is not used. So it should be removed to improve cable flexibility

Screw the ball together using the three small countersunk screws.
Leave some sloop of cable in the ball and cable tie the cable to theinside of the arm (there is a slot provided)

The arms need to be spread to install the ball.

Run a test cycle of the servo to ensure it freely rotates - SARI_SERVO_HW_TEST

Assemble OptoSensor PCB (OpenHornet UTIL_PHOTOSWITCH) and test using OPTOSENSOR_HW_TEST Sketch
Monunt OptoSensor PCB and Mnount Ball and test OptoSensor senses roll interruptor

A possible consideration for PCB redesign is duplicating the number of conductors used
to carry roll motor current.

The Roll Stepper was purchased from AliExpress
https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/4000199720558.html
It is a NEMA 8 Hollow Shaft 3.9V 0.6A Stepper
1.8 degrees per step so 200 steps per revolution

With supply of 3.3V and 600mA stepper motor temp was 36 degrees.
